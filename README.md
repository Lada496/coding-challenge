## Work / Project Examples
### 1. Clone Udemy project
This is a group project aimed at getting used to group work and deepening my understanding of React and React related libraries such as styled-components and Material UI. As the soft side of my role, I lead the group by scheduling and managing the whole project. As the hard side of my role, I created header components including categories' menu list. I used context API with useReducer Hook, which I learned from [this blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively). I also used Material UI for pop-up animations.<br/>

### 2. Jose's Portfolio project
This is a freelance project with [Lily](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilysh32321) to build a photographer portfolio. I was responsible for the coding part and she mainly focused on the design part.<br/>

### 3. e-commerce website
This is my personal project by using dummy API. I managed this project from designing to deployment. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of classical redux, Next.js and Semantic UI.<br/>

## Inspiration
### 1. GraphQL subscription
I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3NHd-PkLrQ) about GraphQL and Websocket and then I've impressed by the convenience of subscription method in GraphQL. Therefore I tried the feature by creating a simple todo list. I would like to deepen my understanding on GraphQL more. <br />

### 2. Framer motion
I read [this article](https://dev.to/sam_piggott/using-framer-motion-to-make-page-transitions-in-react-5ma) about page transition by Framer Motion and got interested in the library. I decided to apply the feature to my portfolio so that my website looks more fancy. I would like to learn more about the library and create more complicated animation.

### 3. darkMode
The first time I encountered the word was when I read [this article](https://www.designagency.gr/web-design-trends-2021-from-dark-mode-to-motion). Then I realized that many websites I usually use also have darkMode. For example [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). I think this feature meets the users' need that they want eye-friendly websites, especially during the night. Therefore, I applied it to my personal blog website project. <br />

## Focus
I want to build and expand my skills and knowledge in React.js. I would like to build a project that covers fundamentals and requires new skills from me so that I can become a better React.js and frontend developer. I am especially interested in the best practice of React.js structures and the way of using React Hooks through the real projects as my next step to learning React.js since I have learned the basic usage of React Hooks, including newer Hooks such as useContext and useReducer. I expect to experience the world standard web development process at Critical Mass.
