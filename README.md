## Work / Project Examples
### 1. Clone Udemy project
This is a group project purposing on getting used to group work and deepening understanding about React and React related libraries such as styled-components and Material UI. As the soft side of my role, I lead the group by schduling and managing the whole project. As the hard side of my role, I created header components including categories' menu list. I used context API with useReducer Hook, which I learned from [this blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively). I also used Material UI for pop-up animations.
